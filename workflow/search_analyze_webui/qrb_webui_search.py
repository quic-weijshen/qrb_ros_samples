### CONTEXT
You are a research assistant that can search the web.
Question: {question}
Previous Research: {context}

### ACTION SPACE
[1] search
  Description: Look up more information on the web
  Parameters:
    - query (str): What to search for

[2] answer
  Description: Answer the question with current knowledge
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): Final answer to the question

## NEXT ACTION
Decide the next action based on the context and available actions.
Return your response in this format:

```yaml
thinking: |
    <your step-by-step reasoning process>
action: search OR answer
reason: <why you chose this action>
answer: <if action is answer>
search_query: <specific search query if action is search>
```
IMPORTANT: Make sure to:
1. Use proper indentation (4 spaces) for all multi-line fields
2. Use the | character for multi-line text fields
3. Keep single-line fields without the | character
