# AI Workflow: A Practical Approach for the LLM Era

## Overview

This project explores how to design effective AI workflows in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). It is **not a methodology guide**, but rather a conceptual summary and a showcase of foundational workflows that are both interesting and extensible.

Inspired by <https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow>, the goal is to help developers and product builders think critically about **what truly matters before diving into implementation**.

***

## Key Principles

### 1. Start With Clear Requirements

Before writing a single line of code, **define your needs**. In the AI era, clarity is everything.

*   Use LLMs as a thinking partner to **organize ideas**, **clarify scenarios**, and ultimately produce a **precise PRD (Product Requirements Document)**.
*   Why does this matter? Your workflow design and future scalability depend directly on how well your requirements are articulated.

***

### 2. Optimize for Cost and Efficiency

Every LLM call incurs a cost—both computational and financial.

*   **Design smart workflows**: Identify which tasks truly require dynamic LLM reasoning and which can be solved using existing open-source tools.
*   Leverage the vast ecosystem of open-source projects to handle static or well-defined tasks, reducing unnecessary LLM usage and overall cost.

***

### 3. Showcase Practical, Extensible Workflows

This repository will feature **select use cases** that are:

*   **Clear and foundational**: Simple enough to understand quickly.
*   **Interesting and practical**: Demonstrating real-world value.
*   **Extensible**: Designed with flexibility for future enhancements.

## A Few Words

Building AI workflows is not just about chaining APIs—it’s about **intentional design**. By starting with strong requirements and balancing LLM usage with open-source solutions, you can create workflows that are cost-effective, scalable, and impactful.
