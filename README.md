# Experimental Agentic Framework Demo for Qualcomm Edge AI

## Overview

This repository provides a **Python-based demonstration** of an **agentic framework** designed to showcase **edge AI capabilities on Qualcomm platforms**. It serves as a practical example of how agent-driven architectures can integrate with modern AI workflows at the edge.

***

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the following outstanding open-source efforts:

*   <https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents>
*   <https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow>

We deeply appreciate the authors and the open-source community for their creativity and collaborative spirit.

## What’s Inside

Beyond the core demonstration, this repository will evolve to include:

*   **Cookbooks**: Practical guides and examples inspired by the referenced papers and GitHub projects.
*   **Tooling Showcase**: Hands-on implementations of key concepts within the agentic framework, including:
    *   **Tooling**
    *   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
    *   **Agents**
    *   **Workflow**
    *   **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
    *   **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)**
    *   **History**
    *   **Memory**

## A Few Words

Edge AI combined with agentic frameworks unlocks new possibilities for **autonomous decision-making**, **context-aware processing**, and **scalable intelligence** at the device level. This repository aims to make these concepts tangible and actionable for developers and researchers.
